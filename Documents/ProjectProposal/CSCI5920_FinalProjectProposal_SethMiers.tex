\documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

\usepackage{graphicx}





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix



% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Game Concept\footnote{Note: Typically a game proposal by a larger corporation will also include a technical analysis, legal analysis, cost and revenue projections, as well as a plethora of art.}}

\subsection{Introduction}
\indent Shattered is a couch co-op fighting game. The goal is to break the blocks underneath your opponents to get them to fall off the map. The last person left standing on the map wins the round. The players can jump to get over gaps and they can slam their hammer into the blocks to break them.
\subsection{Description}
\textit{Cracks in the glass start to creep towards you. You know the block you're standing on won't hold much longer, but now is your chance to swing your hammer and break the block underneath another opponent. Thus, you're left with a decision: should you jump away in an attempt to preserve yourself on the map, or will you take the riskier approach and attempt to break the blocks under your opponent before the block underneath you shatters.}
\subsubsection{General Feel}
Shattered has an attractive scenic background that matches the look and feel of the rest of the game. The game is graphically focused on beauty through lighting, the lighting simply enhances the feel to the game and is not meant to be a distraction to the actual focus of breaking blocks. To assist with player with that focus, flat textures are used, and bright contrasting colors are employed to help identify the characters from the background. The simple graphical feel is meant to enhance the playful 'couch co-op' nature of the game.
\subsection{Main Menu}
The initial screen acts as a menu screen where players can register their controllers and select from a set of characters. Since there won't always be exactly 4 players, the game allows for the selection and registration of characters to certain controllers. After players select their characters and register to a controller, a confirmation button is pressed and the main level is displayed. 
\subsection{Main Level}
The level is a 10 by 10 grid of glass blocks. The glass blocks alter in hue and saturation slightly to help players distinguish between the blocks. The 10 by 10 grid of blocks float high in the sky of an earthly, but cartoony, world. In the background a mountainous scene is visible. Throughout game play the sun will move through the sky, changing the color and feel of the game. In the background birds and clouds can also be seen and move around to help the level appear more dynamic.
This level is as if a flat plane was floating high in the sky and there was a camera in a fixed location looking down at an angle at it.
\subsection{Game Play}
When starting the game a large countdown timer appears in the middle of the screen and counts down from 3. When the timer reaches 0 the timer vanishes and the 4 players are spawned at each of the 4 corners of the level. To help with game balance, each player is spawned at a random corner every single round. At this point the players can move anywhere on the level. If they move to a location where no glass block is present beneath them, then they will fall off the map and be eliminated from this round.
\subsection{Character Design}
The characters are simple in design and fairly flat in texture. Each character looks the same, but each has different accents of color based on what the player chose. The character wields a large hammer, almost as big as they are, with 2 hands. All the character's movements are somewhat cartoonish in style.
\subsection{Controls}
One joystick moves the character in the direction pushed. Pushing 'up' on the joystick will move the character northward on the 10 by 10 grid. Similarly, pushing 'left' on the joystick will move the character westward on the 10 by 10 grid. One button causes the character to jump. This action is triggered as soon as the button is \textit{pressed}. The character cannot jump very high, but their momentum is preserved. This allows the character to run and jump over one block, or one gap. If the gap is larger than one, the character will not make it and will fall off the map. Another button causes the character to swing their hammer. This action is triggered as soon as the button is \textit{released}. Quickly pressing the button will cause the character to swing their hammer at the ground in front of them, causing the block in front of them to shatter and fall into oblivion. If the player presses and holds the button, then the character will swing the hammer and pause as soon as the hammer makes contact with the block in front of them. Cracks will start to appear in a line out in front of them. Briefly holding the button then releasing it will cause 2 blocks in a line in front of them to crack, then shatter. Holding it for longer will cause 3 in a line to crack and shatter. Holding it even longer will cause 4 in a line to crack then shatter. The cracks in the glass are an indicator to any other player that these blocks could break at any moment.
\subsection{End Game}
When all but 1 character has been eliminated, the game will pause and a score screen will be overlayed. The score screen will show basic stats such as how long the player was alive this round, how many rounds the player has won, how many hammer swings they've had, how many jumps they've had. At the bottom of this score screen text is displayed with a timer: "Rematch? Press A in 5...". If the timer runs out, the game will return back to the main menu. All stats will be reset, and game will appear as if it had just started up.
\subsection{Main Feature}
The game solicits real world physics, so that when the glass of the blocks shatter, it looks realistic. Gravity also feels realistic, both with the falling of the glass shards and with the character's movement. Physics of friction are also applied to how the characters start moving and stop moving. However, to help players feel more in control of the character, slight alterations in jump direction can be done after the character has left the ground.
\subsection{Extra Features}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Each time a hammer comes into contact with a block, and after the subsequent shatter, the screen will shake to help indicate to all players that blocks have been shattered. The camera will shake more vigorously based on how many blocks were shattered at that instance.
\item As the characters walk across the blocks, their feet can be heard tapping on the glass.
\item After a short period, blocks that have been shattered will respawn, filling back in the hole that was left by them shattering. They will make a noise and release a short glow to indicate that the block is back.
\item If the players chooses to have a rematch, then their spawn locations are randomized, and their scores continue to accumulate.
\item Music slowly grows more intense based on how few blocks are on the screen as well as how many players are left. The largest variable of control over the music is the tempo. A victory melody is played as soon as one player wins.
\item The characters are rigged so that moving looks fluid and is not distracting to the game play. The character has 2 arms fixed to a hammer, 2 legs, a torso, and a head.
\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Key Features:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textit{Couch Co-Op:} Providing an intimate local experience for friends and family to duke it out.
\item \textit{Realistic Hammer Physics:} The hammer breaks glass just like in real life.
\item \textit{Realistic Destructibles:} The glass breaks just like glass would.
\item \textit{Intuitive Controls:} Tight and clean controls that everyone can grasp.
\item \textit{Great Balance:} All characters are on a level playing filed, so even someone new stands a chance.
\item \textit{Replayablility:} Every game is different!
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Genre}
Casual Action-Strategy Couch Co-Op
\subsection{Platform}
Shattered is designed to be played with a controller. Specifically controllers that support an analog joystick and have at least 2 buttons. The game is targeted towards PC with USB controllers.

\section{Research Component}
Physics simulation will be the primary research topic. Objects in real life will be studied as well as physics equations to help establish a virtual world that resembles similar physical responses to the real world. The main focus will be on rag doll animation with physics based human animation. The secondary focus will be on the physics of hammering and destruction physics.

\section{Work Schedule}
The work can be broken down into 4 Main components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Level Design
    \item Input Configuration
    \item Physics
    \item Character Design
    \item Sound Production
\end{itemize}

Each of these have their sub components too.

\textbf{Level Design:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Main Menu
    \item Main Level
    \item Block Class
    \item Scoring
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Input Configuration:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Xbox 360 USB Input
    \item Multiple Controller
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Physics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Realistic Falling
    \item Realistic Momentum
    \item Realistic Collisions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Character Design:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3D Model
    \item Textures
    \item Rigging
    \item Animation
    \item Ragdoll Physics
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sound Production:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Character Walking
    \item Hammer Sounds
    \item Glass Breaking Sounds
    \item Main Music
    \item Keyed Music
\end{itemize}

The game cannot function without the main level, the character, and the blocks. Since the main research component of this project is the physics of the character itself, the character will be the first thing that I will design. Following that will come the main level and the block class so that I can test the physical interaction between the hammer and glass.



% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure

% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure

% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or

%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
